  <section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">
    
    <t>
      As Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) based Route Origin
      Validation (ROV) becomes deployed in the Internet, the quality of
      the routing control plane, and hence timely and accurate delivery
      of packets in the data plane, depend more and more on prompt and
      accurate propagation of the RPKI data from the originating
      Certification Authorities (CAs), to Relying Parties (RPs), to
      routers.
    </t>

    <t>
      Origination Validation based on stale ROAs allows accidental
      mis-origination.  While delayed ROA propagation to ROV in routers
      can cause loss of good traffic.  Though it may not be reasonable
      today, services such as DDoS cleaners would prefer that ROA
      publication had immediate effect on routing.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      This draft is an exploration of, and recommendations for, timing
      of Resource Public Key Infrastructure publication, propagation,
      and use in relying party caches and routers.
    </t>

    <t>
      There are the questions of how frequently a CA publishes, how
      often an RP pulls, and how often routers pull from their RP(s).
    </t>

    <t>
      For CAs publishing, a few seconds to a minuteseems easily achieved
      with reasonable software.  See <xref target="publish"/>.
    </t>

    <t>
      For RPs pulling, 600s may be optimistic in the short term given
      the load it will put on publication services and one notorious
      repository which is against spec but it should be achievable in
      a while.  An hour would be the longest acceptable window.  See
      <xref target="rp-pull"/>
    </t>

    <t>
      For the router(s) pulling from the RP(s), 300-3600 seconds is a
      wide window.  Remember, the RPKI-Rtr protocol does have the Serial
      Notify PDU, the equivalent of DNS Notify, where the cache tells
      the router that it has some new data.  See <xref
      target="router-pull"/>
    </t>

    <t>
      We discuss each of these in detail below.
    </t>

  <section anchor="Struct" title="Deployment Structure">
    <t>
      Deployment of the RPKI to reach routers has a three-level
      structure as follows:
      <list style="hanging">
	
        <t hangText="Cerification Authorities:">
          The authoritative data of the RPKI are published in a
          distributed set of servers, Certification Authorities, at the
          IANA, RIRs, NIRs, and ISPs (see <xref target="RFC6481"/>).
        </t>
	
        <t hangText="Relying Parties:">
          Relying Parties are a local set of one or more collected and
          verified caches of RPKI data.  A Relying Party, e.g., router
          or other client, MUST have a trust relationship with, and a
          trusted transport channel to, any RP(s) it uses.
        </t>
	
        <t hangText="Routers:">
          A router fetches data from a local cache using the RPKI to
          Router Protocol described in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis"/>.  It is said to be a
          client of the cache.  There are mechanisms for the router to
          assure itself of the authenticity of the cache and to
          authenticate itself to the cache.
        </t>
	
      </list>
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="publish" title="Certification Authority Publishing">
    <t>
     A principal constraint on publication timing is ensuring the CRL
     and Manifest (<xref target="RFC6486"/>) are atomically correct with
     respect to the other repository data.  With rcynic, the directory
     must be atomically correct before it becomes current.  RRDP (<xref
     target="RFC8182"/>) is similar, the directory must be atomically
     correct before it is published.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="rp-pull" title="Replying Party Fetching">
    <t>
     rcynic puts a load on RPKI publication point servers.  Thereofre
     relying party caches have been discouraged from fetching more
     frequently than on the order of an hour.  Times as long as a day
     were even suggested.  With RRDP (<xref target="RFC8182"/>), these
     constraints are no longer relevant.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="router-pull" title="Router Updating">
    <t>
     The rate of change of ROA data can be estimated to remain small,
     maybe on the order of a few ROAs a minute, but with bursts.
     Therefore, the routers may update from the (presumed local) relying
     party cache(s) quite frequently.  Note that <xref
     target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis"/> recommends a polling interval
     of one hour.  This conservative timing is because caches can send a
     Serial Notify PDU to tell routers when there are new data to be
     fetched.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
    <t>
     Route Origin Validation is not a security protocol.  It is intended
     to catch operational errors, and is easily gamed and attacked.
