1.  Introduction

   This document explores, and makes recommendations for, timing of
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) publication of ROV data,
   their propagation, and their use in Relying Parties (RP), caches and
   routers.

   The RPKI supply chain from CAs to reach routers has a structure as
   follows:

   Cerification Authorities:  The authoritative data of the RPKI are
      published by a distributed set of Certification Authorities (CAs)
      at the IANA, RIRs, NIRs, and ISPs (see [RFC6481]).

Internet-Draft               RPKI ROV Timing                    May 2020


   Publication Points:  The CAs publish their authoritative data in
      publicly accessible repositories which have a Publication Point
      (PP) for each CA.

   Relying Parties:  Relying Parties are a local (to the routers) set of
      one or more collected and verified caches of RPKI data which are
      collected from the PPs.

      Currently RPs can pull from other RPs, thereby creating a somewhat
      complex topology.

   Routers:  Validating routers fetch data from local RP caches using
      the RPKI to Router Protocol, [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis].  Routers
      are clients of the caches.  Validating routers MUST have a trust
      relationship with, and a trusted transport channel to, any RP(s)
      they use.  [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis] specifies mechanisms for the
      router to assure itself of the authenticity of the cache(s) and to
      authenticate itself to cache(s).

   As Resource Public Key Infrastructure based Route Origin Validation
   (ROV) becomes deployed in the Internet, the quality of the routing
   control plane, and hence timely and accurate delivery of packets in
   the data plane, increasingly depend on prompt and accurate
   propagation of the RPKI data from the originating Certification
   Authorities (CAs), to Relying Parties (RPs), to Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) speaking routers.

   Origin Validation based on stale ROAs allows accidental or
   intentional mis-origination; announcement of a prefix by an AS which
   does not have the authority to do so.  While delays in ROA
   propagation to ROV in routers can cause loss of good traffic.
   Therefore minimizing propagation time of data from CAs to routers is
   critical.

   Before the data can start on the CA to router supply chain, the
   resource holder (operator) MUST create or delete the relevant ROA(s)
   through the CA's operational interface(s).  The operator is
   responsible for anticipating their future needs for ROAs, be aware of
   the propagation time from creating ROAs to effect on routing, and
   SHOULD create, delete, or modify ROAs sufficiently in advance of any
   needs in the routing system.

   There are questions of how frequently a CA publishes, how often an RP
   pulls, and how often routers pull from their RP(s).  Overall, the
   router(s) SHOULD react within an hour of ROA publication.

   For CAs publishing to PPs, a few seconds to a minute seems easily
   achieved with reasonable software.  See Section 3.

Internet-Draft               RPKI ROV Timing                    May 2020


   Relying Party validating caches periodically retrieve data from CA
   publication points.  RPs using rsync to poll publication points every
   ten minutes would be a burden today, given the load it would put on
   publication services, cf. one notorious repository which is
   structured against specification.  RPs using RRDP impose no such
   load.  As the infrastructure moves from rsync to RRDP
   [I-D.sidrops-bruijnzeels-deprecate-rsync], RRDP is designed for very
   frequent polling as long as Relying Parties use the "If-Modified-
   Since" header and there is a caching infrastructure.  For rsync, an
   hour would be the longest acceptable window.  See Section 4.

   For the BGP speaking router(s) pulling from the RP(s), five minutes
   to an hour is a wide window.  But, the RPKI-Rtr protocol does have
   the Serial Notify PDU, the equivalent of DNS Notify, where the cache
   tells the router that it has new data.  See Section 5.

   We discuss each of these in detail below.

2.  Related Work

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271], the RPKI
   [RFC6480], RPKI Manifests [RFC6486], Route Origin Authorizations
   (ROAs), [RFC6482], the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP)
   [RFC8182], The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to Router
   Protocol [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis], RPKI-based Prefix Validation,
   [RFC6811], and Origin Validation Clarifications, [RFC8481].

3.  Certification Authority Publishing

   A principal constraint on publication timing is ensuring the CRL and
   Manifest ([RFC6486]) are atomically correct with respect to the other
   repository data.  With rsync, the directory must be atomically
   correct before it becomes current.  RRDP ([RFC8182]) is similar, the
   directory must be atomically correct before it is published.

4.  Relying Party Fetching

   rsync puts a load on RPKI publication point servers.  Therefore
   relying party caches have been discouraged from fetching more
   frequently than on the order of an hour.  Times as long as a day were
   even suggested.  We conclude that RPs using rsync SHOULD pull from CA
   publication points once an hour.

   With RRDP ([RFC8182]), such constraints are no longer relevant.
   [RFC8182] makes clear that polling as frequently as once a second is
   acceptable iff Relying Parties use the "If-Modified-Since" header and
   there is caching.  In such circumstances, the RRDP polling interval
   MUST be no more than ten minutes.  We strongly recommend the

   migration from rsync to RRDP in
   [I-D.sidrops-bruijnzeels-deprecate-rsync].

   A number of timers are embedded in the X.509 RPKI data which should
   also be considered.  E.g., CRL publication commitments, expiration of
   EE certificates pointing to Manifests, and the Manifests themselves.
   Some CA operators commonly indicate new CRL information should be
   available in the next 24 hours.  These 24-hour sliding timers,
   combined with fetching RPKI data once a day, cause needless
   brittleness in the face of transient network issues between the CA
   and RP.

5.  Router Updating

   The rate of change of ROA data is estimated to remain small, on the
   order of a few ROAs a minute, but with bursts.  Therefore, the
   routers may update from the (presumed local) relying party cache(s)
   quite frequently.  Note that [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis] recommends a
   polling interval of one hour.  This timing is conservative because
   caches can send a Serial Notify PDU to tell routers when there are
   new data to be fetched.

   A router SHOULD respond with a Serial Query when it receives a Serial
   Notify from a cache.  If a router can not respond appropriately to a
   Serial Notify, then it MUST send a periodic Serial Query no less
   frequently than once an hour.

6.  Effect on Routing

   Once a router has received an End of Data PDU from a cache, the
   effect on Route Origin Validation MUST be a matter of seconds to a
   minute.  The router MAY allow incoming VRPs to affect Origin
   Validation as they arrive instead of waiting for the End of Data PDU.
   See [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis] for some cautions regarding the
   arrival sequence of VRPs.

7.  Alternative Technologies

   Should the supply chain include components or technologies other than
   those in IETF documents, the end effect SHOULD be the same; the
   router(s) SHOULD react to invalid AS origins within the same overall
   time constraint, an hour at most from ROA creation at the CA
   publication point to effect in the router.

8.  Security Considerations

   Despite common misconceptions and marketing, Route Origin Validation
   is not a security protocol.  It is intended to catch operational
   errors, and is easily gamed and attacked.

   If an attacker can add, delete, or modify RPKI data, either in
   repositories or in flight, they can affect routing and thereby steer
   or damage traffic.  The RPKI system design does much to deter these
   attacks.  But the 'last mile' from the cache to the router uses
   transport, as opposed to object, security and is vulnerable.  This is
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis].

   Similarly, if an attacker can delay prompt propagation of RPKI data
   on the supply chain described in this document, they can affect
   routing, and therefore traffic flow, to their advantage.

9.  IANA Considerations
